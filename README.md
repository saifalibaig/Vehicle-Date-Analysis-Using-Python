# Vehicle Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vehicle data to uncover insights related to performance, fuel efficiency, and other key metrics. The analysis aims to help understand trends in the dataset and identify potential improvements or anomalies.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handle missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Compute summary statistics and distributions.
- **Visualization:** Generate charts to represent trends, correlations, and anomalies.
- **Insights:** Extract actionable insights from the data.

## Dataset

The analysis uses the dataset `VehicleData.csv`, which includes the following columns:
- **Make:** The brand of the vehicle.
- **Model:** Specific model details.
- **Year:** Year of manufacture.
- **Fuel Efficiency (MPG):** Miles per gallon data.
- **Engine Size (L):** Engine capacity in liters.
  

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - Libraries:
    - Pandas (Data manipulation)
    - NumPy (Numerical computation)
    - Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)
    - Scikit-learn (Optional: Machine learning or clustering)
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For an interactive analysis environment.

## Project Structure

- `VehicleData.csv`: Input dataset for the analysis.
- `analysis.py`: Python script for the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Results and Insights

- **Finding 1:** The average fuel efficiency has increased over the years for vehicles with engines smaller than 2.0L.
- **Finding 2:** Vehicles from Brand X tend to have higher mileage compared to others.
